# Understanding Snowflake Table Types: Permanent, Transient, Temporary, and External Tables

Snowflake is a powerful cloud data warehouse platform that offers various table types to suit different use cases. In this article, we will explore four of the most commonly used table types in Snowflake: **permanent**, **transient**, **temporary**, and **external** tables. We’ll dive into their features, differences, and ideal use cases to help you choose the right type for your data pipeline.

## Introduction to Snowflake Tables

In general, tables are structured collections of rows and columns used to store data. While this concept is familiar from traditional databases, Snowflake provides additional flexibility by offering multiple table types optimized for specific scenarios.

### Snowflake Table Types Overview

There are nine types of tables in Snowflake:

1. **Permanent**
2. **Transient**
3. **Temporary**
4. **External**
5. **Hybrid**
6. **Dynamic**
7. **Event**
8. **Directory**
9. **Iceberg**

In this article, we'll focus on the first four: **permanent**, **transient**, **temporary**, and **external** tables. These are the most widely used and essential for understanding how data is stored and managed in Snowflake.

## 1. Permanent Tables

### Definition
By default, any table created in Snowflake without specifying a keyword like `TRANSIENT`, `TEMPORARY`, or `EXTERNAL` is a **permanent table**.

### Key Features
- **Persistence**: Data remains until explicitly dropped.
- **Time Travel**: Allows recovery of data within a specified time frame (0–90 days).
- **Fail-safe**: Offers an additional 7-day period (non-configurable) after Time Travel expires.
- **Cloning**: Can be cloned into permanent, transient, or temporary tables.
- **Storage Cost**: Incurs storage costs since data is stored long-term.

### Use Case
Use permanent tables when:
- You need **long-term storage** of critical data.
- You want to retain historical records.
- You require **data recovery** capabilities (e.g., if someone accidentally deletes or modifies data).

### Example SQL
```sql
CREATE TABLE customer (
    customer_id INT,
    customer_name VARCHAR
);
```

## 2. Transient Tables

### Definition
Transient tables are similar to permanent tables but do not have Fail-safe protection and offer limited Time Travel retention (maximum 1 day).

### Key Features
- **Intermediate Data Processing**: Ideal for staging or intermediate transformations.
- **Retention Time**: Max 1 day (cannot exceed this).
- **No Fail-safe**: No extra 7-day safety net.
- **Cloning**: Cannot be cloned into permanent tables.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Less expensive than permanent tables because of reduced data retention.

### Use Case
Use transient tables when:
- You need **short-term storage** for staging data during ETL processes.
- You can afford to lose the data if it's recoverable from the source.
- You don’t need extended recovery options.

### Example SQL
```sql
CREATE TRANSIENT TABLE employee (
    eid INT,
    ename VARCHAR
);
```

## 3. Temporary Tables

### Definition
Temporary tables are session-specific and exist only during the current session.

### Key Features
- **Session-Specific**: Automatically dropped when the session ends.
- **No Retention**: Cannot set a retention time.
- **Highly Volatile**: Not visible to other users or sessions.
- **Cloning**: Cannot be cloned into permanent tables.

### Use Case
Use temporary tables when:
- You need **intermediate results** within a single session.
- You're performing complex queries and want to avoid redundant computations.
- The data doesn’t need to persist beyond the session.

### Example SQL
```sql
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE orders (
    oid INT,
    product_id INT
);
```

You can also create **local** or **global** temporary tables:
```sql
CREATE GLOBAL TEMPORARY TABLE products (
    pid INT,
    pname VARCHAR
);

CREATE LOCAL TEMPORARY TABLE temp_data (
    id INT,
    value VARCHAR
);
```

## 4. External Tables

### Definition
External tables reference data stored outside Snowflake, such as in Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage.

### Key Features
- **No Storage Cost**: Snowflake only stores metadata; actual data resides externally.
- **Read-Only**: Does not support DML operations like INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.
- **Compute Cost Only**: You pay only for compute resources used to query the data.
- **No Time Travel**: Since data isn’t stored in Snowflake, no Time Travel or Fail-safe features apply.

### Use Case
Use external tables when:
- You want to **analyze large datasets** stored in a data lake without copying them to Snowflake.
- You prefer **cost-effective querying** where storage cost minimization is important.
- Your data doesn't require frequent updates or transactional operations.

### Example SQL
To create an external table, you must first define an **external stage** pointing to your data lake:
```sql
CREATE STAGE my_s3_stage
URL = 's3://my-bucket/data/'
CREDENTIALS = (AWS_KEY_ID='...' AWS_SECRET_KEY='...');

CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE ext_customer (
    cust_id INT,
    name STRING
)
LOCATION = @my_s3_stage
FILE_FORMAT = (TYPE = CSV);
```

## Comparing Table Types

| Feature               | Permanent | Transient | Temporary | External |
|-----------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Default Table Type    | ✅         | ❌         | ❌         | ❌        |
| Persistence           | Indefinite| Short-term| Session   | External |
| Time Travel           | Up to 90d | 1 day     | N/A       | ❌        |
| Fail-safe              | ✅ (7 days)| ❌         | ❌         | ❌        |
| Cloning to Permanent  | ✅         | ❌         | ❌         | ❌        |
| Storage Cost          | ✅         | Lower     | Lowest    | ❌        |
| Visibility Across Sessions | ✅     | ✅         | ❌         | ✅        |
| DML Support           | ✅         | ✅         | ✅         | ❌        |

## Advanced Considerations

### Schema Override with Same Table Names
Snowflake allows creating a **temporary or transient table** with the same name as a permanent table. However, during operations:
- **Temporary tables take precedence** over permanent ones within the same session. For example, in the same session, if there are temporary and permanent table with same name, and if we try to drop that table the temporary table will be targeted and will get delete, rather than permanent one.
- Dropping a table affects only the **session-specific version** unless the permanent one is explicitly targeted.

### Cloning Behavior
- **Permanent tables** can be cloned into any table type.
- **Transient and temporary tables** cannot be cloned into permanent tables.

### View Creation
All table types (permanent, transient, temporary, external) support view creation. This is useful for:
- Applying row/column-level security.
- Sharing data with reporting teams.
- Simplifying complex queries.

## Choosing the Right Table Type

### Use Permanent Tables When:
- Long-term storage is required.
- Data is critical and needs recovery options.
- Historical analysis or dimensional modeling is involved.

### Use Transient Tables When:
- Intermediate data processing is needed.
- Data can be regenerated from source.
- Cost savings on data retention is important.

### Use Temporary Tables When:
- Session-specific intermediate results are needed.
- Avoiding redundant computations during complex queries.
- Data is not required beyond the session.

### Use External Tables When:
- Querying data directly from data lakes.
- Minimizing storage costs in Snowflake.
- Performing analytics on static or semi-static datasets.

## Conclusion

Choosing the right table type in Snowflake is crucial for optimizing performance, managing costs, and ensuring data availability. Whether you're working with permanent tables for critical historical data, transient tables for staging, temporary tables for session-specific processing, or external tables for cost-efficient analytics, each has its own strengths and ideal use cases.
